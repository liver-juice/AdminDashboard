what.

the trending and announcement section is connected to the content grid, yet it 
overflows past the center section into the right hand side grid.
we should:
sepperate it from the content and put it back in the main grid that splits
everthing under the header into 3 secstions, left main and right. put it in the right.
we can also set the three buttons up there. that way we have the icons, announcements,
trending and the buttons all lined up nicely in the right hand section.
